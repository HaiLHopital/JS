quick rundown of my projects:
* checklist - basically the first try of plain JS without React or any other library
* todo_list_react - hello world with some extra steps, first working React app
* rozetka-ract - homemade rozetka.com.ua with React, but without real backend, and looks bit clunky
* full_stack_blog - node.js + express + postgresql backend, React+bootstrap for frontend
* coolCSS - some navbars, not very original code tho :p
